### How to play
- Use WASD to move the camera around. Scroll up and down on the mouse to zoom in/out.
- To open the pause menu press P.
- Click a turret icon and place it on a node, turrets can be upgraded/sold. This is done by clicking a turret already placed on a node.
- Kill enemies before they reach the end of the path. 10 lives are provided.


### Status/Bugs
- There are 5 waves of enemies, once the last wave has been defeated the game just loops. So a victory screen is missing. 
- Scene reloading does not work properly, if you have to reload you will have to quit the app. Not sure what causes this bug.
